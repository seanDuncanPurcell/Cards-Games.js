# Cards-Games.js
This is a simple challenge to my self to make playable card games in the browser.

Goals:
1) Using OOP principles to create objects and classes that allow code to be used across mulitple different typs of games
2) Experiment with different ways of organising classes and game objects, experiment with encapsilating members of js objects so that they are protected from the outside.
3) Pracitice using git to version and control the code writing process, and practiece using gitHub as a remote repo.

Game 1 BlackJack
  I'm starting with black because it is on of the simplest of the games and will allow get useable produce the fastest so I can move on to experimenting with optimisation as well as AI decision making.
