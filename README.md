# Cards-Games.js
This is a simple challenge to my self to make playable card games in the browser.

Goals:
1) Using OOP principles, create objects and classes that allow code to be used across mulitple different typs of card games.
2) Experiment with different ways of organising classes and objects, experiment with encapsilating members of js objects so that they are protected from the outside.
3) Pracitice using git to version and control the code writing process, and practice using gitHub as a remote repo.

Game 1 BlackJack
  I'm starting with black because it is one of the simplest card games, and will allow get useable produce the fastest so I can move on to experimenting with optimisation as well as AI decision making.
  
  Update 12/16/2020: due to restrictions on what actions a deal can or can not take, it looks like I will not beable to due much with decision making until I can move one to Poker games like texas holdem, draw, ect..
